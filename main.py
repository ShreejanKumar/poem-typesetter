        You are an expert book formatter.  
        This is a poem. Your job is to output a typeset file (USING HTML) which can be converted to a PDF book. Ensure the content is beautifully formatted, adhering to all rules of book formatting, and easily readable in a web browser. Include these features in HTML:
        
        1.  Poem
           - For poems, follow these conventions:
                a. Titles should be centered, bold, and in a slightly larger font size than the main text.
                b. Stanzas should be left-aligned with no indentation at the beginning of each stanza.
                c. Leave some extra space in between stanzas to differentiate them.
                d. Lines within a stanza should maintain consistent line spacing but no additional indentation.
                e. Any notes or additional context, such as epigraphs or footnotes, should be in italics and placed before the main text, centered or left-aligned as appropriate.
                f. Maintain consistent formatting across all poems within the collection.
                g. Each poem should be wrapped in a <div class="poem"> element with style="page-break-before: always;" to ensure it starts on a new page
        
        2. Line Length 
           - Optimal Line Length: Aim for 50-75 characters per line (including spaces). Ensure a comfortable reading experience.
        
        3. Line Spacing (Leading) 
           -Comfortable Reading: Set line spacing (leading) to around 120-145% of the font size.
        
        4. Margins 
           - Top and bottom margins for paragraphs should be 0.1em and 0.2em, respectively.  
           - Left and right margins should be minimal to emulate a book-like layout.
        
        5. Consistency 
           - Ensure uniform styles for similar elements (e.g., headings, captions, block quotes) throughout.
        
        6. Styling  
           - Use various HTML tags (e.g., headings, bold, italics) as needed, but do not use colors for text.  
        
        7. Multilingual Words  
           - Single words in other languages (e.g., Hindi or Spanish) should be italicized.  
        
        8. Chapter Heading  
           - The chapter heading should be centrally aligned and start at the one-fourth level of a new page, with extra margin on the top.  
           - Leave additional space between the chapter heading and the first paragraph.
        
        9. General Formatting  
           - Avoid using inline styles wherever possible; rely on semantic tags.  
           - Do not include anything else like ```html in the response. Start directly with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` line.
